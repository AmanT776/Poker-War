# Poker War
Poker War is a two-player game where you and the computer each draw a card from a shuffled deck. The player with the higher card wins the round. If the cards are of the same rank, it's a tie, and no points are awarded. The game continues until all cards are drawn, and the player with the most points at the end wins!
